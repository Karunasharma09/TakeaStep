        <h3 style="text-align: left;">1.Introduction to Cleanliness</h3>
        </div>
        <div class = "para">
            <p>
              Cleanliness means that there is no dirt, no dust, no stains, no bad smells. The goals of cleanliness are health, beauty, absence of offensive odour and to avoid the spreading of dirt and contaminants to oneself and others.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the help of cleanliness, we can keep our physical and mental health clean, which will make us feel good. Cleanliness gives rise to a good character by keeping body, mind, and soul clean and peaceful. Maintaining cleanliness is the essential part of healthy living because it is the cleanliness only which helps to improve our personality by keeping clean externally and internally.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is everybody’s responsibility and one should keep themselves and their surroundings clean and hygienic. It also brings good and positive thoughts in the mind which slows down the occurrence of diseases.
            </p>

            <h3 style="text-align: left; color:black">2. Importance of Cleanliness</h3>
            <p>
              Sanitation and neatness play an important role in our day to day routine. It is important as it prevents dangerous diseases like Dengue, typhoid, hepatitis, and other diseases caused by mosquito bite, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              Maintaining a clean environment is for the health of all humans, as their health completely depends on the atmosphere. A bad environment is solely responsible for spoiling the health of the people around. ... We must maintain the cleanliness of our bodies, homes, buildings, surroundings and environment to have good health.</p>
            <p>
              Diseases like Jaundice, Cholera, Ascariasis, Leptospirosis, Ringworm, Scabies, Schistosomiasis, Trachoma, etc can be spread due to eating contaminated food, drinking contaminated water or living in an unhygienic condition. Trash also spread bad odour which is difficult to tolerate. There will also be an accumulation of trash and dirt if clean measures aren’t taken.
            </p>
            <h3 style="text-align: left; color:black">3. Small steps that you can take </h3>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li><p style="font-weight:bold;">Refuse single-use items.</p> Take note on how often you rely on single-use items and choose to replace them with more sustainable versions. Refusing plastic straws and disposable cutlery when you go out and bringing your own containers for leftovers are a few ways you can start today.</li>
                <li><p style="font-weight:bold;">Make sure your waste goes to the right place</p> Do your best to ensure that the waste you dispose of ends up where it should. Recycle the materials that are recyclable in your area and make sure to reduce the likelihood of your garbage ending up in the environment by keeping a lid on your trash can when it’s outside.</li>
                <li><p style="font-weight:bold;">Compost</p>Composting at home reduces the volume of garbage sent to landfills and reduces the chance of some products becoming marine debris.</li>
              </ul>
